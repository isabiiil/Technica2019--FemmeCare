      <p class="card-text">The Period Collective is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization, committed to supplying feminine hygiene products to homeless and low-income women in the greater Chicago area.
      <br>Our organization's focus is on supplying products to shelters, traditional housing facilities, food banks, schools, prisons and other organizations that work with homeless and low-income girls and women. We are aiming to fill a void, as feminine hygiene products are not frequently being donated and organizations working to help these women do not have a budget for supplying these items.</p>
